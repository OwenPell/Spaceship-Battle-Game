This is a game that I am currently working on to deepen my understanding of Python and Pygame.
I followed a youtube video to help me when I would get stuck and it is also where I downloaded the assets from.
I'm currently working on adding powerups that the players can pick up to boost health, add sheilds, and add different bullet effects i.e. homing bullets.
